                <h1>Discover The Beauty of Little Boracay</h1>
                <p class="col1">Calatagan is one of the best places in Batangas if you wanted a beach not too far from Manila.
                    It is very accessible and could only take about 3 to 4 hours drive via Tagaytay-Nasugbu road.
                    This municipalicity is known for its sandy shores making it also good as a camping destination.
                    Burot and Stilts are one of the most popular and most visited beaches here in Calatagan.
                    Maybe you have not heard yet about the island that they call here as Little Boracay and Sand
                    Bar?
                </p> 
                <p class="col1">One of the highlights of Little Boracay is its relatively undeveloped and unspoiled nature
                    compared to other more commercialized beaches in the Philippines.
                    Visitors can enjoy the beauty of nature without the crowds often found in more popular tourist
                    spots.</p>
                <p class="col1">Accommodation options in Little Boracay range from basic beachfront cottages to more upscale
                    resorts, catering to various budgets and preferences. Visitors can choose to stay overnight or
                    opt for a day trip from nearby cities like Manila or Tagaytay.</p>

                <p class="col2">Little Boracay in Calatagan Batangas is famous for its white sand and clear beach similar to
                    Boracay Philippines.
                    It is best for family outings and safe for toddlers because water is mostly just up to knee
                    high.
                    Different fishes and starfishes can be seen nearby.
                </p>
                <p class="col2">Little Boracay in Calatagan, Batangas
                    is a stunning beach destination that has earned its nickname due to its resemblance to the
                    famous Boracay Island.
                    It offers pristine white sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and a serene atmosphere that
                    attracts both locals and
                    tourists seeking a tranquil getaway.
                </p>
                <p class="col2">While it may not have the same level of development or amenities as Boracay Island, Little
                    Boracay in Calatagan offers a more laid-back and tranquil atmosphere, making it an ideal
                    destination for those seeking relaxation and natural beauty away from the crowds.</p>
